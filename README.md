# Clinical-information-Systems - Evaluating a Patient Portal Text Reminder System
This project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a text reminder system integrated into a patient portal to improve patient engagement in health screenings. The study involved a pre- and post-implementation analysis using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data to assess screening eligibility, patient participation rates, and adherence trends.

A structured evaluation framework was implemented, utilizing descriptive statistics to establish baseline screening compliance, chi-square tests to measure short-term behavioral changes, and logistic regression to analyze the long-term impact on screening adherence. The analysis targeted specific demographics, including women aged 40-49 for mammograms and men aged 55-69 for prostate cancer screenings.

Collaboration with healthcare professionals, data analysts, IT specialists, and statisticians ensured a comprehensive approach to assessing the interventionâ€™s effectiveness. Key findings provided actionable insights for optimizing patient portal functionalities, improving digital patient engagement strategies, and supporting evidence-based healthcare interventions.

This project contributed to the advancement of Clinical Information Systems by demonstrating how digital interventions can enhance patient participation in preventive care. The evaluation framework and findings serve as a reference for future innovations in health informatics, patient-centered technologies, and healthcare quality improvement initiatives.
